====== Welcome to Lord Sroff's Galactic Freight ======
We're a group of roleplayers and friends who have been playing since 2016 or so with the Star Wars D6 system by West End Games.

This wiki aims to chronicle all those nights and stat boxes into one place.

==== COMBINED ACTIONS ====

There are a number of situations where it pays to work as a team by assisting one another to get the job done.
The character with the highest Dice Code makes the skill check.
The assisting team-mates don’t roll; instead they add +1 to the result for every full Dice they have in the relevant skill.

====MULTIPLE ACTION PENALTY====
Characters can attempt to do lots of things when it’s their time to act, up to the number of full Dice they have in Dexterity. For each extra action declared, all actions are rolled at -XD, where X is the number of extra actions declared.
